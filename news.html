                Model has an increased accuracy now at about 70 something odd percent and only overfitting by about a percent. With that said it still performed awful on the most recent Colby vs Buckley fight night, as expected. Many of the fighters don't contain a lot of historical data resulting in shitty predictions.

                Changed the number of fights it goes back for each fighter before creating the model. I had it at shifting 1 fight back for each fighter that way there was no data leakage when predicting future fights. I've switched that to 2 fights back and the model has improved drastically. The model is still overfitting, but that is something I will continue to work on. It is just a painful process of messing with features / trial and error and to be honest at this moment in time that is the last thing I want to do.
